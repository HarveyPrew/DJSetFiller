	abstract = {Recommender systems play an important role in providing an engaging experience on online music streaming services. However, the musical domain presents distinctive challenges to recommender systems: tracks are short, listened to multiple times, typically consumed in sessions with other tracks, and relevance is highly context-dependent. In this paper, we argue that modeling users’ preferences at the beginning of a session is a practical and effective way to address these challenges. Using a dataset from Spotify, a popular music streaming service, we observe that a) consumption from the recent past and b) session-level contextual variables (such as the time of the day or the type of device used) are indeed predictive of the tracks a user will stream—much more so than static, average preferences. Driven by these findings, we propose CoSeRNN, a neural network architecture that models users’ preferences as a sequence of embeddings, one for each session. CoSeRNN predicts, at the beginning of a session, a preference vector, based on past consumption history and current context. This preference vector can then be used in downstream tasks to generate contextually relevant just-in-time recommendations efficiently, by using approximate nearest-neighbour search algorithms. We evaluate CoSeRNN on session and track ranking tasks, and find that it outperforms the current state of the art by upwards of 10\% on different ranking metrics. Dissecting the performance of our approach, we find that sequential and contextual information are both crucial.},

While today’s MRSs considerably help users to find interesting music in these huge catalogs, MRS research is still facing substantial challenges. In particular when it comes to build, incorporate, and evaluate recommendation strategies that integrate information beyond simple user–item interactions or content-based descriptors, but dig deep into the very essence of listener needs, preferences, and intentions, MRS research becomes a big endeavor and related publications quite sparse. The purpose of this trends and survey article is twofold. We first identify and shed light on what we believe are the most pressing challenges MRS research is facing, from both academic and industry perspectives. We review the state of the art toward solving these challenges and discuss its limitations. Second, we detail possible future directions and visions we contemplate for the further evolution of the field. The article should therefore serve two purposes: giving the interested reader an overview of current challenges in MRS research and providing guidance for young researchers by identifying interesting, yet under-researched, directions in the field.},

	abstract = {Automatic music recommendation has become an increasingly relevant problem in recent years, since a lot of music is now sold and consumed digitally. Most recommender systems rely on collaborative filtering. However, this approach suffers from the cold start problem: it fails when no usage data is available, so it is not effective for recommending new and unpopular songs. In this paper, we propose to use a latent factor model for recommendation, and predict the latent factors from music audio when they cannot be obtained from usage data. We compare a traditional approach using a bag-of-words representation of the audio signals with deep convolutional neural networks, and evaluate the predictions quantitatively and qualitatively on the Million Song Dataset. We show that using predicted latent factors produces sensible recommendations, despite the fact that there is a large semantic gap between the characteristics of a song that affect user preference and the corresponding audio signal. We also show that recent advances in deep learning translate very well to the music recommendation setting, with deep convolutional neural networks significantly outperforming the traditional approach.},

	abstract = {In many online platforms, people must choose how broadly to allocate their energy. Should one concentrate on a narrow area of focus, and become a specialist, or apply oneself more broadly, and become a generalist? In this work, we propose a principled measure of how generalist or specialist a user is, and study behavior in online platforms through this lens. To do this, we construct highly accurate community embeddings that represent communities in a high-dimensional space. We develop sets of community analogies and use them to optimize our embeddings so that they encode community relationships extremely well. Based on these embeddings, we introduce a natural measure of activity diversity, the GS-score. Applying our embedding-based measure to online platforms, we observe a broad spectrum of user activity styles, from extreme specialists to extreme generalists, in both community membership on Reddit and programming contributions on GitHub. We find that activity diversity is related to many important phenomena of user behavior. For example, specialists are much more likely to stay in communities they contribute to, but generalists are much more likely to remain on platforms as a whole. We also find that generalists engage with significantly more diverse sets of users than specialists do. Furthermore, our methodology leads to a simple algorithm for community recommendation, matching state-of-the-art methods like collaborative filtering. Our methods and results introduce an important new dimension of online user behavior and shed light on many aspects of online platform use.},

From research done on music recommendation systems (MRS), there are three main methods to recommend songs; context based, content based and collaborative filtering. A hybrid combination of the three methods has the potential to improve music recommendation; however, it has not been fully explored. In this paper, a hybrid music recommendation system, using emotion as the context and musical data as content is proposed. To achieve this, the outputs of a convolution neural network (CNN) and a weight extraction method are combined. The CNN extracts user emotion from a favorite playlist and extracts audio features from the songs and metadata. The output of the user emotion and audio features is combined, and a collaborative filtering method is used to select the best song for recommendation. For performance, proposed recommendation system is compared with content similarity music recommendation system (CSMRS) as well as other personalized music recommendation systems.},

However, only a few studies estimated fader or equalizer (EQ) gains controlled by DJs. In this study, we propose a method that jointly estimates time-varying fader and EQ gains so as to reproduce the mix from individual source tracks. The method approximates the equalizer filters with a linear combination of a fixed equalizer filter and a constant gain to convert the joint estimation into a convex optimization problem. For the experiment, we collected a new DJ mix dataset that consists of 5,040 real-world DJ mixes with 50,742 transitions, and evaluated the proposed method with a mix reconstruction error. The result shows that the proposed method estimates the time-varying fader and equalizer gains more accurately than existing methods and simple baselines.},

Two major problems that most CF approaches have to contend with are scalability and sparseness of the user profiles. To tackle these issues, in this paper, we describe a CF algorithm alternating-least-squares with weighted-λ-regularization (ALS-WR), which is implemented on a parallel Matlab platform. We show empirically that the performance of ALS-WR (in terms of root mean squared error (RMSE)) monotonically improves with both the number of features and the number of ALS iterations. We applied the ALS-WR algorithm on a large-scale CF problem, the Netflix Challenge, with 1000 hidden features and obtained a RMSE score of 0.8985, which is one of the best results based on a pure method. In addition, combining with the parallel version of other known methods, we achieved a performance improvement of 5.91\% over Netflix’s own CineMatch recommendation system. Our method is simple and scales well to very large datasets.},

MusicMixer mixes songs based on audio similarity calculated via beat analysis and latent topic analysis of the chromatic signal in the audio. The topic represents latent semantics about how chromatic sounds are generated. Given a list of songs, a DJ selects a song with beat and sounds similar to a specific point of the currently playing song to seamlessly transition between songs. By calculating the similarity of all existing pairs of songs, the proposed system can retrieve the best mixing point from innumerable possibilities. Although it is comparatively easy to calculate beat similarity from audio signals, it has been difficult to consider the semantics of songs as a human DJ considers. To consider such semantics, we propose a method to represent audio signals to construct topic models that acquire latent semantics of audio. The results of a subjective experiment demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed latent semantic analysis method.},

MusicMixer continuously mixes and plays songs using an automatic music mixing method that employs audio similarity calculations. By calculating similarities between song sections that can be naturally mixed, MusicMixer enables seamless song transitions. Though song mixing is the most fundamental and important factor in DJ performance, it is difficult for untrained people to seamlessly connect songs. MusicMixer realizes automatic song mixing using an audio signal processing approach; therefore, users can perform DJ mixing simply by selecting a song from a list of songs suggested by the system, enabling effective DJ song mixing and lowering entry barriers for the inexperienced. We also propose personalization for song suggestions using a preference memorization function of MusicMixer.},

A number of recommendation techniques have been proposed for many applications, among which music recommendation is a kind of popular Internet services. Unlike other recommendation services, music recommendation needs to consider the interaction and content information, as well as the inherent correlation and feedback among music playlist. Thus, in this paper, we model music recommendation as a Markov Decision Process, and consider the music recommendation as a playlist recommendation task. Along this line, we propose a novel reinforcement learning based model, called RLWRec, to exploit the optimal strategy of playlist. Two novel strategies are designed to solve the curse of state space and efficient music recommendation. Experiments on real dataset validate the effectiveness of our proposed method.},

For this type of interaction, the system suggests song slices taken from songs selected from a playlist, which could go well with the beats of whatever master song is being played. In addition the system allows the synchronization of multiple songs, thus permitting ﬂexible, coherent and rapid progressions in the DJ’s mix. BeatJockey uses the Reactable, a musical tangible user interface (TUI), and it has been designed to be used by all DJs regardless of their level of expertise, as the system helps the novice while bringing new creative opportunities to the expert.},

In total, 113 teams submitted 1,228 runs in the main track; 33 teams submitted 239 runs in the creative track. The highest performing team in the main track achieved an R-precision of 0.2241, an NDCG of 0.3946, and an average number of recommended songs clicks of 1.784.

A fundamental aspect of music perception is that music is experienced in temporal context and in sequence. In this work we present DJ-MC, a novel reinforcement-learning framework for music recommendation that does not recommend songs individually but rather song sequences, or playlists, based on a model of preferences for both songs and song transitions. The model is learned online and is uniquely adapted for each listener. To reduce exploration time, DJ-MC exploits user feedback to initialize a model, which it subsequently updates by reinforcement. We evaluate our framework with human participants using both real song and playlist data. Our results indicate that DJ-MC's ability to recommend sequences of songs provides a significant improvement over more straightforward approaches, which do not take transitions into account.},

The results show that larger sets containing only good items do not necessarily result in higher choice satisfaction compared to smaller sets, as the increased recommendation set attractiveness is counteracted by the increased diﬃculty of choosing from these sets.

These systems passively track different sorts of user behavior, such as purchase history, watching habits and browsing activity, in order to model user preferences. Unlike the much more extensively researched explicit feedback, we do not have any direct input from the users regarding their preferences. In particular, we lack substantial evidence on which products consumer dislike. In this work we identify unique properties of implicit feedback datasets. We propose treating the data as indication of positive and negative preference associated with vastly varying conﬁdence levels. This leads to a factor model which is especially tailored for implicit feedback recommenders. We also suggest a scalable optimization procedure, which scales linearly with the data size. The algorithm is used successfully within a recommender system for television shows. It compares favorably with well tuned implementations of other known methods. In addition, we offer a novel way to give explanations to recommendations given by this factor model.},

	abstract = {Music plays an important part in people’s lives to regulate their emotions throughout the day. We conducted an online user study to investigate how the emotional state relates to the use of emotionally laden music. We found among 359 participants that they in general prefer emotionally laden music that correspond with their emotional state. However, when looking at personality traits, diﬀerent patterns occurred. We found that when in a negative emotional state, those who scored high on openness, extraversion, and agreeableness tend to cheer themselves up with happy music, while those who scored high on neuroticism tend to increase their worry with sad music. With our results we show general patterns of music usage, but also individual diﬀerences. Our results contribute to the improvement of applications such as recommender systems in order to provide tailored recommendations based on users’ personality and emotional state.},

A series of 6 studies investigated lay beliefs about music, the structure underlying music preferences, and the links between music preferences and personality. The data indicated that people consider music an important aspect of their lives and listening to music an activity they engaged in frequently. Using multiple samples, methods, and geographic regions, analyses of the music preferences of over 3,500 individuals converged to reveal 4 music-preference dimensions: Reflective and Complex, Intense and Rebellious, Upbeat and Conventional, and Energetic and Rhythmic. Preferences for these music dimensions were related to a wide array of personality dimensions (e.g., Openness), self-views (e.g., political orientation), and cognitive abilities (e.g., verbal IQ).

	abstract = {We propose a novel approach to context-aware music recommendation - recommending music suited for places of interest (POIs). The suggested hybrid approach combines two techniques -- one based on representing both POIs and music with tags, and the other based on the knowledge of the semantic relations between the two types of items. We show that our approach can be scaled up using a novel music auto-tagging technique and we compare it in a live user study to: two non-hybrid solutions, either based on tags or on semantic relations; and to a context-free but personalized recommendation approach. In the considered scenario, i.e., a situation defined by a context (the POI), we show that personalization (via music preference) is not sufficient and it is important to implement effective adaptation techniques to the user's context. In fact, we show that the users are more satisfied with the recommendations generated by combining the tag-based and knowledge-based context adaptation techniques, which exploit orthogonal types of relations between places and music tracks.},

While previous work has treated a playlist collection as an undifferentiated whole, we propose to build playlist models which are tuned to speciﬁc categories or dialects of playlists. Toward this end, we develop a general class of ﬂexible and scalable playlist models based upon hypergraph random walks. To evaluate the proposed models, we present a large corpus of categorically annotated, user-generated playlists. Experimental results indicate that category-speciﬁc models can provide substantial improvements in accuracy over global playlist models.},

	abstract = {User experience in social media involves rich interactions with the media content and other participants in the community. In order to support such communities, it is important to understand the factors that drive the users' engagement. In this paper we show how to define statistical models of different complexity to describe patterns of song listening in an online music community. First, we adapt the LDA model to capture music taste from listening activities across users and identify both the groups of songs associated with the specific taste and the groups of listeners who share the same taste. Second, we define a graphical model that takes into account listening sessions and captures the listening moods of users in the community. Our session model leads to groups of songs and groups of listeners with similar behavior across listening sessions and enables faster inference when compared to the LDA model. Our experiments with the data from an online media site demonstrate that the session model is better in terms of the perplexity compared to two other models: the LDA-based taste model that does not incorporate cross-session information and a baseline model that does not use latent groupings of songs.},
