	abstract = {Recommender systems play an important role in providing an engaging experience on online music streaming services. However, the musical domain presents distinctive challenges to recommender systems: tracks are short, listened to multiple times, typically consumed in sessions with other tracks, and relevance is highly context-dependent. In this paper, we argue that modeling users’ preferences at the beginning of a session is a practical and effective way to address these challenges. Using a dataset from Spotify, a popular music streaming service, we observe that a) consumption from the recent past and b) session-level contextual variables (such as the time of the day or the type of device used) are indeed predictive of the tracks a user will stream—much more so than static, average preferences. Driven by these findings, we propose CoSeRNN, a neural network architecture that models users’ preferences as a sequence of embeddings, one for each session. CoSeRNN predicts, at the beginning of a session, a preference vector, based on past consumption history and current context. This preference vector can then be used in downstream tasks to generate contextually relevant just-in-time recommendations efficiently, by using approximate nearest-neighbour search algorithms. We evaluate CoSeRNN on session and track ranking tasks, and find that it outperforms the current state of the art by upwards of 10\% on different ranking metrics. Dissecting the performance of our approach, we find that sequential and contextual information are both crucial.},

While today’s MRSs considerably help users to find interesting music in these huge catalogs, MRS research is still facing substantial challenges. In particular when it comes to build, incorporate, and evaluate recommendation strategies that integrate information beyond simple user–item interactions or content-based descriptors, but dig deep into the very essence of listener needs, preferences, and intentions, MRS research becomes a big endeavor and related publications quite sparse. The purpose of this trends and survey article is twofold. We first identify and shed light on what we believe are the most pressing challenges MRS research is facing, from both academic and industry perspectives. We review the state of the art toward solving these challenges and discuss its limitations. Second, we detail possible future directions and visions we contemplate for the further evolution of the field. The article should therefore serve two purposes: giving the interested reader an overview of current challenges in MRS research and providing guidance for young researchers by identifying interesting, yet under-researched, directions in the field.},

	abstract = {Automatic music recommendation has become an increasingly relevant problem in recent years, since a lot of music is now sold and consumed digitally. Most recommender systems rely on collaborative filtering. However, this approach suffers from the cold start problem: it fails when no usage data is available, so it is not effective for recommending new and unpopular songs. In this paper, we propose to use a latent factor model for recommendation, and predict the latent factors from music audio when they cannot be obtained from usage data. We compare a traditional approach using a bag-of-words representation of the audio signals with deep convolutional neural networks, and evaluate the predictions quantitatively and qualitatively on the Million Song Dataset. We show that using predicted latent factors produces sensible recommendations, despite the fact that there is a large semantic gap between the characteristics of a song that affect user preference and the corresponding audio signal. We also show that recent advances in deep learning translate very well to the music recommendation setting, with deep convolutional neural networks significantly outperforming the traditional approach.},

	abstract = {In many online platforms, people must choose how broadly to allocate their energy. Should one concentrate on a narrow area of focus, and become a specialist, or apply oneself more broadly, and become a generalist? In this work, we propose a principled measure of how generalist or specialist a user is, and study behavior in online platforms through this lens. To do this, we construct highly accurate community embeddings that represent communities in a high-dimensional space. We develop sets of community analogies and use them to optimize our embeddings so that they encode community relationships extremely well. Based on these embeddings, we introduce a natural measure of activity diversity, the GS-score. Applying our embedding-based measure to online platforms, we observe a broad spectrum of user activity styles, from extreme specialists to extreme generalists, in both community membership on Reddit and programming contributions on GitHub. We find that activity diversity is related to many important phenomena of user behavior. For example, specialists are much more likely to stay in communities they contribute to, but generalists are much more likely to remain on platforms as a whole. We also find that generalists engage with significantly more diverse sets of users than specialists do. Furthermore, our methodology leads to a simple algorithm for community recommendation, matching state-of-the-art methods like collaborative filtering. Our methods and results introduce an important new dimension of online user behavior and shed light on many aspects of online platform use.},

From research done on music recommendation systems (MRS), there are three main methods to recommend songs; context based, content based and collaborative filtering. A hybrid combination of the three methods has the potential to improve music recommendation; however, it has not been fully explored. In this paper, a hybrid music recommendation system, using emotion as the context and musical data as content is proposed. To achieve this, the outputs of a convolution neural network (CNN) and a weight extraction method are combined. The CNN extracts user emotion from a favorite playlist and extracts audio features from the songs and metadata. The output of the user emotion and audio features is combined, and a collaborative filtering method is used to select the best song for recommendation. For performance, proposed recommendation system is compared with content similarity music recommendation system (CSMRS) as well as other personalized music recommendation systems.},

However, only a few studies estimated fader or equalizer (EQ) gains controlled by DJs. In this study, we propose a method that jointly estimates time-varying fader and EQ gains so as to reproduce the mix from individual source tracks. The method approximates the equalizer filters with a linear combination of a fixed equalizer filter and a constant gain to convert the joint estimation into a convex optimization problem. For the experiment, we collected a new DJ mix dataset that consists of 5,040 real-world DJ mixes with 50,742 transitions, and evaluated the proposed method with a mix reconstruction error. The result shows that the proposed method estimates the time-varying fader and equalizer gains more accurately than existing methods and simple baselines.},

Two major problems that most CF approaches have to contend with are scalability and sparseness of the user profiles. To tackle these issues, in this paper, we describe a CF algorithm alternating-least-squares with weighted-λ-regularization (ALS-WR), which is implemented on a parallel Matlab platform. We show empirically that the performance of ALS-WR (in terms of root mean squared error (RMSE)) monotonically improves with both the number of features and the number of ALS iterations. We applied the ALS-WR algorithm on a large-scale CF problem, the Netflix Challenge, with 1000 hidden features and obtained a RMSE score of 0.8985, which is one of the best results based on a pure method. In addition, combining with the parallel version of other known methods, we achieved a performance improvement of 5.91\% over Netflix’s own CineMatch recommendation system. Our method is simple and scales well to very large datasets.},

MusicMixer mixes songs based on audio similarity calculated via beat analysis and latent topic analysis of the chromatic signal in the audio. The topic represents latent semantics about how chromatic sounds are generated. Given a list of songs, a DJ selects a song with beat and sounds similar to a specific point of the currently playing song to seamlessly transition between songs. By calculating the similarity of all existing pairs of songs, the proposed system can retrieve the best mixing point from innumerable possibilities. Although it is comparatively easy to calculate beat similarity from audio signals, it has been difficult to consider the semantics of songs as a human DJ considers. To consider such semantics, we propose a method to represent audio signals to construct topic models that acquire latent semantics of audio. The results of a subjective experiment demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed latent semantic analysis method.},

MusicMixer continuously mixes and plays songs using an automatic music mixing method that employs audio similarity calculations. By calculating similarities between song sections that can be naturally mixed, MusicMixer enables seamless song transitions. Though song mixing is the most fundamental and important factor in DJ performance, it is difficult for untrained people to seamlessly connect songs. MusicMixer realizes automatic song mixing using an audio signal processing approach; therefore, users can perform DJ mixing simply by selecting a song from a list of songs suggested by the system, enabling effective DJ song mixing and lowering entry barriers for the inexperienced. We also propose personalization for song suggestions using a preference memorization function of MusicMixer.},

A number of recommendation techniques have been proposed for many applications, among which music recommendation is a kind of popular Internet services. Unlike other recommendation services, music recommendation needs to consider the interaction and content information, as well as the inherent correlation and feedback among music playlist. Thus, in this paper, we model music recommendation as a Markov Decision Process, and consider the music recommendation as a playlist recommendation task. Along this line, we propose a novel reinforcement learning based model, called RLWRec, to exploit the optimal strategy of playlist. Two novel strategies are designed to solve the curse of state space and efficient music recommendation. Experiments on real dataset validate the effectiveness of our proposed method.},

For this type of interaction, the system suggests song slices taken from songs selected from a playlist, which could go well with the beats of whatever master song is being played. In addition the system allows the synchronization of multiple songs, thus permitting ﬂexible, coherent and rapid progressions in the DJ’s mix. BeatJockey uses the Reactable, a musical tangible user interface (TUI), and it has been designed to be used by all DJs regardless of their level of expertise, as the system helps the novice while bringing new creative opportunities to the expert.},

A fundamental aspect of music perception is that music is experienced in temporal context and in sequence. In this work we present DJ-MC, a novel reinforcement-learning framework for music recommendation that does not recommend songs individually but rather song sequences, or playlists, based on a model of preferences for both songs and song transitions. The model is learned online and is uniquely adapted for each listener. To reduce exploration time, DJ-MC exploits user feedback to initialize a model, which it subsequently updates by reinforcement. We evaluate our framework with human participants using both real song and playlist data. Our results indicate that DJ-MC's ability to recommend sequences of songs provides a significant improvement over more straightforward approaches, which do not take transitions into account.},

The results show that larger sets containing only good items do not necessarily result in higher choice satisfaction compared to smaller sets, as the increased recommendation set attractiveness is counteracted by the increased diﬃculty of choosing from these sets.

Unlike the much more extensively researched explicit feedback, we do not have any direct input from the users regarding their preferences. In particular, we lack substantial evidence on which products consumer dislike. In this work we identify unique properties of implicit feedback datasets. We propose treating the data as indication of positive and negative preference associated with vastly varying conﬁdence levels. This leads to a factor model which is especially tailored for implicit feedback recommenders. We also suggest a scalable optimization procedure, which scales linearly with the data size. The algorithm is used successfully within a recommender system for television shows. It compares favorably with well tuned implementations of other known methods. In addition, we offer a novel way to give explanations to recommendations given by this factor model.},

	abstract = {The present research examined individual differences in music preferences. A series of 6 studies investigated lay beliefs about music, the structure underlying music preferences, and the links between music preferences and personality. The data indicated that people consider music an important aspect of their lives and listening to music an activity they engaged in frequently. Using multiple samples, methods, and geographic regions, analyses of the music preferences of over 3,500 individuals converged to reveal 4 music-preference dimensions: Reflective and Complex, Intense and Rebellious, Upbeat and Conventional, and Energetic and Rhythmic. Preferences for these music dimensions were related to a wide array of personality dimensions (e.g., Openness), self-views (e.g., political orientation), and cognitive abilities (e.g., verbal IQ).

The suggested hybrid approach combines two techniques -- one based on representing both POIs and music with tags, and the other based on the knowledge of the semantic relations between the two types of items. We show that our approach can be scaled up using a novel music auto-tagging technique and we compare it in a live user study to: two non-hybrid solutions, either based on tags or on semantic relations; and to a context-free but personalized recommendation approach. In the considered scenario, i.e., a situation defined by a context (the POI), we show that personalization (via music preference) is not sufficient and it is important to implement effective adaptation techniques to the user's context. In fact, we show that the users are more satisfied with the recommendations generated by combining the tag-based and knowledge-based context adaptation techniques, which exploit orthogonal types of relations between places and music tracks.},

In order to support such communities, it is important to understand the factors that drive the users' engagement. In this paper we show how to define statistical models of different complexity to describe patterns of song listening in an online music community. First, we adapt the LDA model to capture music taste from listening activities across users and identify both the groups of songs associated with the specific taste and the groups of listeners who share the same taste. Second, we define a graphical model that takes into account listening sessions and captures the listening moods of users in the community. Our session model leads to groups of songs and groups of listeners with similar behavior across listening sessions and enables faster inference when compared to the LDA model. Our experiments with the data from an online media site demonstrate that the session model is better in terms of the perplexity compared to two other models: the LDA-based taste model that does not incorporate cross-session information and a baseline model that does not use latent groupings of songs.},

At Amazon.com, we use recommendation algorithms to personalize the online store for each customer. The store radically changes based on customer interests, showing programming titles to a software engineer and baby toys to a new mother. There are three common approaches to solving the recommendation problem: traditional collaborative filtering, cluster models, and search-based methods. Here, we compare these methods with our algorithm, which we call item-to-item collaborative filtering. Unlike traditional collaborative filtering, our algorithm's online computation scales independently of the number of customers and number of items in the product catalog. Our algorithm produces recommendations in real-time, scales to massive data sets, and generates high quality recommendations.},

The basic slope one scheme is suggested as a new reference scheme for collaborative filtering. By factoring in items that a user liked separately from items that a user disliked, we achieve results competitive with slower memory-based schemes over the standard benchmark EachMovie and Movielens data sets while better fulfilling the desiderata of CF applications.

	abstract = {This paper proposes a method for recommending music items without explicit feedback. Context and content features are used as auxiliary information to compensate for implicit feedback. The recent development of communication technology and portable electronic devices has changed the way of consuming music. We can access a vast amount of music items via online music streaming services. As a result, ﬁnding appropriate music items from enormous resources gets to be difﬁcult for users. To help users discover their favorite music items, recommender systems in the music domain have been studied. This paper focuses on two challenges speciﬁc to music recommender systems: the difﬁculty of obtaining explicit feedback such as ratings, and the importance of making use of context information. To handle the context information as auxiliary information to compensate for implicit feedback, this paper employs FMs (Factorization Machines), in which the context information is treated as features. Utilizing the merit of FMs that can easily introduce features, this paper also introduces content features in addition to context features. As it is known that using low-level content features directly is not effective because of the semantic gap, this paper proposes two types of abstract content features: UGP (user genre proﬁle) and UCP (user content proﬁle). The effectiveness of the proposed method and the effect of negative sampling methods are evaluated in terms of MPR with \#nowplaying-rs and LFM-1b dataset. The result of the experiment shows that the proposed method outperforms wALS (weighted Alternating Least Squares), which is one of the popular music recommendation algorithms based on matrix factorization. The characteristics of the proposed sampling methods are investigated with different settings of the parameters and the ratio of negative samples. As for the effectiveness of each feature, it is found that a feature is effective when JS (Jensen-Shannon) divergence of popularity distribution among different feature values is large. It is also shown that the UCP and UGP cluster labels are more effective than using content features directly.},

Nearly everywhere in the world via the World Wide Web, you can access more than 2500 daily newspapers through their online Web sites 27], providing tens of thousands of news articles of potential interest. We need information lters to help us prioritize news articles so that we may spend more of our time reading articles of interest. Newspaper lters present the additional opportunity for personalization, which has been shown to have a strong appeal to newspaper readers 5]. Practical considerations have prevented hardcopy newspapers from obtaining any degree of personal customization, but online newspapers are not subject to the same constraints as printed matter. Online newspaper presentation can be personalized in terms of contents , layout, media (text only, text with pictures, text with video, etc.), advertisements and more. While there have been attempts at customization of newspapers and ltering of newspapers 16, 25], these attempts have not completely countered the weaknesses of human and computer lters.

	abstract = {Music recommender systems have become a key technology to support the interaction of users with the increasingly larger music catalogs of on-line music streaming services, on-line music shops, and personal devices. An important task in music recommender systems is the automated continuation of music playlists, that enables the recommendation of music streams adapting to given (possibly short) listening sessions. Previous works have shown that applying collaborative filtering to collections of curated music playlists reveals underlying playlist-song co-occurrence patterns that are useful to predict playlist continuations. However, most music collections exhibit a pronounced long-tailed distribution. The majority of songs occur only in few playlists and, as a consequence, they are poorly represented by collaborative filtering. We introduce two feature-combination hybrid recommender systems that extend collaborative filtering by integrating the collaborative information encoded in curated music playlists with any type of song feature vector representation. We conduct off-line experiments to assess the performance of the proposed systems to recover withheld playlist continuations, and we compare them to competitive pure and hybrid collaborative filtering baselines. The results of the experiments indicate that the introduced feature-combination hybrid recommender systems can more accurately predict fitting playlist continuations as a result of their improved representation of songs occurring in few playlists.},

Furthermore, the qualities of music and the consumers' temporal preferences are not organically related, resulting in poor music suggestion performance. In this study, the Deep Neural Based Music Recommendation (DNBMR) method is suggested to address these challenges, which takes into account both music attributes and the customer's temporal favorites. The music data was transformed into one vector and then represented to a low-dimensional space using a Deep Neural Network. Long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks are applied to collect long and short-term favorites from an individual's listening history as well. By utilizing music metadata and discovering new consumers' preferences as soon as they hear music, In the item aspect, DNBMR addresses the cold start issue.

	abstract = {Automatic music recommendation has become an increasingly relevant problem in recent years, since a lot of music is now sold and consumed digitally. Most recommender systems rely on collaborative filtering. However, this approach suffers from the cold start problem: it fails when no usage data is available, so it is not effective for recommending new and unpopular songs. In this paper, we propose to use a latent factor model for recommendation, and predict the latent factors from music audio when they cannot be obtained from usage data. We compare a traditional approach using a bag-of-words representation of the audio signals with deep convolutional neural networks, and evaluate the predictions quantitatively and qualitatively on the Million Song Dataset. We show that using predicted latent factors produces sensible recommendations, despite the fact that there is a large semantic gap between the characteristics of a song that affect user preference and the corresponding audio signal. We also show that recent advances in deep learning translate very well to the music recommendation setting, with deep convolutional neural networks significantly outperforming the traditional approach.},

This observation leads us to propose a novel deep convolutional neural network architecture inspired by Inception, where Inception modules have been replaced with depthwise separable convolutions. We show that this architecture, dubbed Xception, slightly outperforms Inception V3 on the ImageNet dataset (which Inception V3 was designed for), and significantly outperforms Inception V3 on a larger image classification dataset comprising 350 million images and 17,000 classes. Since the Xception architecture has the same number of parameters as Inception V3, the performance gains are not due to increased capacity but rather to a more efficient use of model parameters.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes the Global-Local Similarity Function (GLSF) to exploit the multi-scale cues in track sequences for automatic playlist generation (APG). Unlike previous neighborhood-based methods only looking on local similarities for a given playlist, GLTS is constructed by first modeling the fine-grained audio features of each track, then capturing the long-term relations among consecutive tracks. Specifically, the fine-grained audio features are captured beat-by-beat to represent the rhythmic variation of music. The long- term relations are modeled by a designed track distance constraint (TD-constraint) to alleviate the incoherences and un- smooth transition in track sequences. The fine-grained audio features and TD-constraint are aggregated as the final GLSF by a simple distance function. Objective and subjective evaluations show that GLSF-based APG achieves better smooth transition and ensure the long-term content consistency among the tracks. Furthermore, GLSF yields a better understanding of the sequential relationship between tracks and propose a promising way to improve APG algorithms. 1},

	abstract = {The music domain is among the most important ones for adopting recommender systems technology. In contrast to most other recommendation domains, which predominantly rely on collaborative filtering (CF) techniques, music recommenders have traditionally embraced content-based (CB) approaches. In the past years, music recommendation models that leverage collaborative and content data -- which we refer to as content-driven models -- have been replacing pure CF or CB models. In this survey, we review 55 articles on content-driven music recommendation. Based on a thorough literature analysis, we first propose an onion model comprising five layers, each of which corresponds to a category of music content we identified: signal, embedded metadata, expert-generated content, user-generated content, and derivative content. We provide a detailed characterization of each category along several dimensions. Second, we identify six overarching challenges, according to which we organize our main discussion: increasing recommendation diversity and novelty, providing transparency and explanations, accomplishing context-awareness, recommending sequences of music, improving scalability and efficiency, and alleviating cold start. Each article addresses one or more of these challenges is categorized according to the content layers of our onion model, the article's goal(s), and main methodological choices. Furthermore, articles are discussed in temporal order to shed light on the evolution of content-driven music recommendation strategies. Finally, we provide our personal selection of the persisting grand challenges which are still waiting to be solved in future research endeavors.},

Music is one of the most popular types of online information and there are now hundreds of music streaming and download services operating on the World-Wide Web. Some of the music collections available are approaching the scale of ten million tracks and this has posed a major challenge for searching, retrieving, and organizing music content. Research efforts in music information retrieval have involved experts from music perception, cognition, musicology, engineering, and computer science engaged in truly interdisciplinary activity that has resulted in many proposed algorithmic and methodological solutions to music search using content-based methods. This paper outlines the problems of content-based music information retrieval and explores the state-of-the-art methods using audio cues (e.g., query by humming, audio fingerprinting, content-based music retrieval) and other cues (e.g., music notation and symbolic representation), and identifies some of the major challenges for the coming years.},

	abstract = {In the context of music information retrieval, similarity-based approaches are useful for a variety of tasks that benefit from a query-by-example scenario. Music however, naturally decomposes into a set of semantically meaningful factors of variation. Current representation learning strategies pursue the disentanglement of such factors from deep representations, resulting in highly interpretable models. This allows the modeling of music similarity perception, which is highly subjective and multi-dimensional. While the focus of prior work is on metadata driven notions of similarity, we suggest to directly model the human notion of multi-dimensional music similarity. To achieve this, we propose a multi-input deep neural network architecture, which simultaneously processes mel-spectrogram, CENS-chromagram and tempogram in order to extract informative features for the different disentangled musical dimensions: genre, mood, instrument, era, tempo, and key. We evaluated the proposed music similarity approach using a triplet prediction task and found that the proposed multi-input architecture outperforms a state of the art method. Furthermore, we present a novel multi-dimensional analysis in order to evaluate the influence of each disentangled dimension on the perception of music similarity.},

	abstract = {Music recommendation has been one of the most used information retrieval services on internet. Finding suitable music for users' demands from tens of millions of music relies on the understanding of music content. Traditional studies usually focus on music representation based on massive user behavioral data and music meta-data, which ignore the audio characteristic of music. However, it is found that the melodic characteristics of music themselves can be further used to understand music. Moreover, how to utilize large-scale audio data to learn music representation is not well explored. To this end, we propose a self-supervised learning model for music representation. We firstly utilize a beat-level music pre-training model to learn the structure of music. Then, we use a multi-task learning framework to model music self-representation and co-relations between music, concurrently. Besides, we propose several downstream tasks to evaluate music representation, including music genre classification, music highlight, and music similarity retrieval. Extensive experiments on multiple music datasets demonstrate our model's superiority over baselines on learning music representation.},

A common and successful music recommendation approach is collaborative filtering, which has worked well in this domain. One major drawback of this method is that it suffers from a cold-start problem, and it requires a lot of user-personalized information. It is an ineffective mechanism for recommending new and unpopular songs as well as for new users. In this article, we report a hybrid methodology that uses the song's content information. We use MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) content data, a compressed version of an audio song that contains digital information about a song and is machine-readable. We describe a model called MSA-SRec (MIDI Based Self Attentive Sequential Music Recommendation), a latent factor-based self-attentive deep learning model that uses a substantial amount of sequential information as content information of the song for recommendation generation. We use MIDI data of a song that is under-explored content information for music recommendation. We show that using MIDI as content data with user and item latent vector produces reasonable recommendations. We also demonstrate that using MIDI over other music metadata performs better with various state-of-the-art models of recommendation systems.},

	abstract = {Numerous domestic and foreign studies have demonstrated that music can relieve stress and that listening to music is one method of stress relief used presently. Although stress-relief music is available on the market, various music genres produce distinct effects on people. Clinical findings have indicated that approximately 30 \% of people listen to inappropriate music genres for relaxation and, consequently, their stress level increases. Therefore, to achieve the effect of stress relief, choosing the appropriate music genre is crucial. For example, a 70-year-old woman living in a military community since childhood might not consider general stress-relief music to be helpful in relieving stress, but when patriotic songs are played, her autonomic nervous system automatically relaxes because of her familiarity with the music style. Therefore, people have dissimilar needs regarding stress-relief music. In this paper, we proposed a personalized stress-relieving music recommendation system based on electroencephalography (EEG) feedback. The system structure comprises the following features: (a) automated music categorization, in which a new clustering algorithm, K-MeansH, is employed to precluster music and improve processing time; (b) the access and analysis of users’ EEG data to identify perceived stress-relieving music; and (c) personalized recommendations based on collaborative filtering and provided according to personal preferences. Experimental results indicated that the overall clustering effect of K-MeansH surpassed that of K-Means and K-Medoids by approximately 71 and 57 \%, respectively. In terms of accuracy, K-MeansH also surpassed K-Means and K-Medoids.},

	abstract = {Since the inception of Recommender Systems (RS), the accuracy of the recommendations in terms of relevance has been the golden criterion for evaluating the quality of RS algorithms. However, by focusing on item relevance, one pays a significant price in terms of other important metrics: users get stuck in a "filter bubble" and their array of options is significantly reduced, hence degrading the quality of the user experience and leading to churn. Recommendation, and in particular session-based/sequential recommendation, is a complex task with multiple - and often conflicting objectives - that existing state-of-the-art approaches fail to address. In this work, we take on the aforementioned challenge and introduce Scalarized Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (SMORL) for the RS setting, a novel Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework that can effectively address multi-objective recommendation tasks. The proposed SMORL agent augments standard recommendation models with additional RL layers that enforce it to simultaneously satisfy three principal objectives: accuracy, diversity, and novelty of recommendations. We integrate this framework with four state-of-the-art session-based recommendation models and compare it with a single-objective RL agent that only focuses on accuracy. Our experimental results on two real-world datasets reveal a substantial increase in aggregate diversity, a moderate increase in accuracy, reduced repetitiveness of recommendations, and demonstrate the importance of reinforcing diversity and novelty as complementary objectives.},

	abstract = {The role of recommendation systems in the diversity of content consumption on platforms is a much-debated issue. The quantitative state of the art often overlooks the existence of individual attitudes toward guidance, and eventually of different categories of users in this regard. Focusing on the case of music streaming, we analyze the complete listening history of about 9k users over one year and demonstrate that there is no blanket answer to the intertwinement of recommendation use and consumption diversity: it depends on users. First we compute for each user the relative importance of different access modes within their listening history, introducing a trichotomy distinguishing so-called ‘organic’ use from algorithmic and editorial guidance. We thereby identify four categories of users. We then focus on two scales related to content diversity, both in terms of dispersion – how much users consume the same content repeatedly – and popularity – how popular is the content they consume. We show that the two types of recommendation offered by music platforms – algorithmic and editorial – may drive the consumption of more or less diverse content in opposite directions, depending also strongly on the type of users. Finally, we compare users’ streaming histories with the music programming of a selection of popular French radio stations during the same period. While radio programs are usually more tilted toward repetition than users’ listening histories, they often program more songs from less popular artists.

With properly equipped communication services, users can easily obtain the widely distributed videos, music, and documents they want. Because of its usability and capacity requirements, music is more popular than other types of multimedia data. Documents and videos are difficult to view on mobile phones' small screens, and videos' large data size results in high overhead for retrieval. But advanced compression techniques for music reduce the required storage space significantly and make the circulation of music data easier. This means that users can capture their favorite music directly from the Web without going to music stores. Accordingly, helping users find music they like in a large archive has become an attractive but challenging issue over the past few years.},

This investigation examined the relevance and limitations of these findings for cultures in which individuals possess more interdependent models of the self. In 2 studies, personal choice generally enhanced motivation more for American independent selves than for Asian interdependent selves. In addition, Anglo American children showed less intrinsic motivation when choices were made for them by others than when they made their own choices, whether the others were authority figures or peers. In contrast, Asian American children proved most intrinsically motivated when choices were made for them by trusted authority figures or peers. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Research shows associations between music preferences and a wide variety of sociodemographic and individual characteristics, including personality traits, values, ethnicity, gender, social class, and political orientation. It also reveals the importance of social influences on music tastes, more specifically from family and peers, as well as the central role of music tastes in the construction of personal and social identities.

These dimensions are affected by formal characteristics of social structure, the organization of educational systems, and internal relations among cultural dimensions. The dynamics of ritual classification are mediated according to whether artistic production is carried out through commercial, professional, or bureaucratic means.},

The use of a predetermined array of genres assumes that music genres are rigid and stable concepts, whereas in reality genre boundaries continually emerge, evolve, and disappear. Inspired by Lamont’s (2010) call to study classification systems ‘from the ground up’, we present an alternative strategy to measure patterns of music taste using an open question about artist preferences. We build a two-mode network of artists and respondents to identify clusters of respondents that have similar relationships to the same set of artists. Our results show that research using measurements of cultural omnivorousness based on genre preferences might be hampered, as it misses important subdivisions within genres and is not able to capture respondents who combine specific aspects within and across music genres.},

The average listener, however, lacks both the time and the skill necessary to create comparable experiences, despite access to same source material. As a result, user-generated listening sessions often lack the sophistication popularized by modern artists, e.g. tracks are played in their entirety with little or no thought given to their ordering. To these ends, this paper presents methods for automatically sequencing existing playlists and adding DJ-style crossfade transitions between tracks: the former is modeled as a graph traversal problem, and the latter as an optimization problem.

The generator uses two differentiable digital signal processing components, an equalizer (EQ) and a fader, to mix two tracks selected by a data generation pipeline. The generator has to set the parameters of the EQs and fader in such a way that the resulting mix resembles real mixes created by human DJ, as judged by the discriminator counterpart.

	abstract = {A DJ mix is a sequence of music tracks concatenated seamlessly, typically rendered for audiences in a live setting by a DJ on stage. As a DJ mix is produced in a studio or the live version is recorded for music streaming services, computational methods to analyze DJ mixes, for example, extracting track information or understanding DJ techniques, have drawn research interests. Many of previous works are, however, limited to identifying individual tracks in a mix or segmenting it, and the sizes of the datasets are usually small. In this paper, we provide an in-depth analysis of DJ music by aligning a mix to its original music tracks. We set up the subsequence alignment such that the audio features are less sensitive to the tempo or key change of the original track in a mix. This approach provides temporally tight mix-to-track matching from which we can obtain cue-points, transition length, mix segmentation, and musical changes in DJ performance. Using 1,557 mixes from 1001Tracklists including 13,728 tracks and 20,765 transitions, we conduct the proposed analysis and show a wide range of statistics, which may elucidate the creative process of DJ music making.},

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2109.05418},
	abstract = {Deep neural network based methods have been successfully applied to music source separation. They typically learn a mapping from a mixture spectrogram to a set of source spectrograms, all with magnitudes only. This approach has several limitations: 1) its incorrect phase reconstruction degrades the performance, 2) it limits the magnitude of masks between 0 and 1 while we observe that 22\% of time-frequency bins have ideal ratio mask values of over{\textasciitilde}1 in a popular dataset, MUSDB18, 3) its potential on very deep architectures is under-explored. Our proposed system is designed to overcome these. First, we propose to estimate phases by estimating complex ideal ratio masks (cIRMs) where we decouple the estimation of cIRMs into magnitude and phase estimations. Second, we extend the separation method to effectively allow the magnitude of the mask to be larger than 1. Finally, we propose a residual UNet architecture with up to 143 layers. Our proposed system achieves a state-of-the-art MSS result on the MUSDB18 dataset, especially, a SDR of 8.98{\textasciitilde}dB on vocals, outperforming the previous best performance of 7.24{\textasciitilde}dB.

	abstract = {The music source separation problem, where the task at hand is to estimate the audio components that are present in a mixture, has been at the centre of research activity for a long time. In more recent frameworks, the problem is tackled by creating deep learning models, which attempt to extract information from each component by using Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) spectrograms as input. Most approaches assume that one source is present at each time-frequency point, which allows to allocate this point from the mixture to the desired source. Since this assumption is strong and is reported not to hold in practice, there is a problem that arises from the use of the magnitude of the STFT as input to these networks, which is the absence of the Fourier phase information during the separated source reconstruction. The recovery of the Fourier phase information is neither easily tractable, nor computationally efficient to estimate. In this paper, we propose a novel Attentive MultiResUNet architecture, that uses real-valued Short-Time Discrete Cosine Transform data as inputs. This step avoids the phase recovery problem, by estimating the appropriate values within the network itself, rather than employing complex estimation or post-processing algorithms. The proposed novel network features a U-Net type structure with residual skip connections and an attention mechanism that correlates the skip connection and the decoder output at the previous level. The proposed network is used for the first time in source separation and is more computationally efficient than state-of-the-art separation networks and features favourable performance compared to the state-of-the-art with a fraction of the computational cost.},

In this paper, we present a network and training strategy that relies on the strong use of data augmentation to use the available annotated samples more efficiently.

We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and DIC) we won the ISBI cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin. Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent GPU.

The multi-task learning is achieved by globally aggregating the skip connections of a beat tracking system built around temporal convolutional networks, and feeding them into a tempo classiﬁcation layer. The beneﬁt of this approach is investigated by the inclusion of training data for which tempo-only annotations are available, and which is shown to provide improvements in beat tracking accuracy.},

	abstract = {Every piece of music is characterized by its key, melody, harmony, metre, and rhythm. Musical information retrieval tasks like transcription, chord estimation, and harmony analysis require musical key data as the fundamental comprehension for their implementation. Even though several investigations were carried out by researchers aimed at developing an optimum key profile for a given melody, the possibilities of finding the key using machine learning techniques have been least explored. In this paper, we present a novel approach to determine the musical key of a given song. The proposed model features a simple architecture for learning and classification. It was tested with four distinct machine learning algorithms namely K-nearest neighbor (KNN), Naïve Bayes (NB), Discriminant Analysis (DA), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). In addition, a dataset of different genres of music has been compiled, for our experiments. The Pitch Class Profile (PCP) distribution of our dataset has been compared with renowned datasets and it showed similar distribution with the others. We optimized our model with the best classifier from all the four machine learning techniques we used. Out of the four machine learning algorithms used in our model, the SVM gave an accuracy value of 91.49\% with the highest precision and recall values. The KNN approach showed an accuracy of 89.76\% followed by Naïve Bayes and the Discriminant Analysis classifiers with an accuracy of 87.11\% and 86.77\% respectively. Also, the error rates of these different approaches ranged from 8.51\% to 13.23\%. These results show that the proposed model with SVM algorithm has a considerably higher accuracy value, and in comparison with recent publications, it is evident that our model can play a pivotal role in the efficient determination of keys since it brings together information related to musical theory and supervised learning techniques for classification.},

Initially, short-time Fourier transform, pitch, Timbre, MNMF, and proposed LBP and bag of words-based features are extracted. Subsequently, the extracted features are subjected to ensemble classifiers, where support vector machine, neural network, random forest are deployed. The output attained from ensemble classifiers is then classified using deep belief network (DBN) which classifies the music genres in a precise way. For precise detection, the training of DBN is made optimal via tuning the weights. This optimization is carried out by a Whale Integrated Sea Lion Algorithm.

	abstract = {The ACM Recommender Systems Challenge 2018 focused on the task of automatic music playlist continuation, which is a form of the more general task of sequential recommendation. Given a playlist of arbitrary length with some additional meta-data, the task was to recommend up to 500 tracks that fit the target characteristics of the original playlist. For the RecSys Challenge, Spotify released a dataset of one million user-generated playlists. Participants could compete in two tracks, i.e., main and creative tracks. Participants in the main track were only allowed to use the provided training set, however, in the creative track, the use of external public sources was permitted. In total, 113 teams submitted 1,228 runs to the main track; 33 teams submitted 239 runs to the creative track. The highest performing team in the main track achieved an R-precision of 0.2241, an NDCG of 0.3946, and an average number of recommended songs clicks of 1.784. In the creative track, an R-precision of 0.2233, an NDCG of 0.3939, and a click rate of 1.785 was obtained by the best team. This article provides an overview of the challenge, including motivation, task definition, dataset description, and evaluation. We further report and analyze the results obtained by the top performing teams in each track and explore the approaches taken by the winners. We finally summarize our key findings, discuss generalizability of approaches and results to domains other than music, and list the open avenues and possible future directions in the area of automatic playlist continuation.},

	shorttitle = {Energy {Flash}},
	abstract = {Twenty-five years since acid house and Ecstasy revolutionized pop culture, Simon Reynolds's landmark rave history Energy Flash has been expanded and updated to cover twenty-first-century developments like dubstep and EDM's recent takeover of America.Author of the acclaimed postpunk history Rip It Up and Start Again, Reynolds became a rave convert in the early nineties. He experienced first-hand the scene's drug-fuelled rollercoaster of euphoria and darkness. He danced at Castlemorton, the illegal 1992 mega-rave that sent spasms of anxiety through the Establishment and resulted in the Criminal Justice and Public Order Bill. Mixing personal reminiscence with interviews and ultra-vivid description of the underground's ever-changing sounds as they mutated under the influence of MDMA and other drugs, Energy Flash is the definitive chronicle of electronic dance culture.From rave's origins in Chicago house and Detroit techno, through Ibiza, Madchester and the anarchic free-party scene, to the pirate-radio underworld of jungle and UK garage, and then onto 2000s-shaping genres such as grime and electro, Reynolds documents with authority, insight and infectious enthusiasm the tracks, DJs, producers and promoters that soundtracked a generation. A substantial final section, added for this new Faber edition, brings the book right up to date, covering dubstep's explosive rise to mass popularity and America's recent but ardent embrace of rave. Packed with interviews with participants and charismatic innovators like Derrick May, Goldie and Aphex Twin, Energy Flash is an infinitely entertaining and essential history of dance music.},
